# Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of stroke in individuals based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques. Stroke prediction is crucial for early intervention and preventive healthcare.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [source link]. It contains anonymized patient information including demographic details, pre-existing medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and medical test results.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stroke-prediction.git
   cd stroke-prediction
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Files
- `stroke_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and machine learning model development process.
- `data/stroke_data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `stroke_prediction.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stroke_prediction.ipynb
   ```
   
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell sequentially.
   
3. The notebook includes sections for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize relationships between variables, identify correlations, and understand data distributions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract new features if necessary, select relevant features for modeling.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict stroke likelihood for new data points.

## Results
- **Model Performance**: Report the performance metrics of the selected model(s).
- **Insights**: Discuss insights gained from the analysis that could aid in stroke prevention strategies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for predicting stroke risk based on health data. Further improvements could involve collecting more diverse data or fine-tuning the model parameters for better accuracy.
